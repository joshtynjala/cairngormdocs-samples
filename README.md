# CairngormDocs Sample Apps

These sample apps for Adobe Flex originally appeared on the community-managed CairngormDocs website, which no longer exists. I found them in an archive while creating a port of [Cairngorm for Feathers UI](https://github.com/feathersui/feathersui-cairngorm), and I thought it would be nice to preserve them for comparison and reference purposes.

The ActionScript 3.0 source code for the Flex version of Cairngorm is available on SourceForge.
